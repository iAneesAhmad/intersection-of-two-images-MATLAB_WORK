# MATLAB Script for Intersection of Two Images


## Before Intersection of Image (a) and (b)

### Image (a) - RGB

### Image (b) - RGB
![img-b-rgb](https://github.com/iAneesAhmad/intersection-of-two-images-MATLAB_WORK/blob/main/Intersection_of_Two_Images/img(b)-rgb.jpg?raw=true)
### Image (b) - Grayscale
